# Dynamic-Jquery-Menu-from-Database
Create a dynamic menu using jquery and storing the menu items in a database

I like using the jquery slidemenu. I found that I needed a way to make it change dynamically depending on various things.

If you load the SQL file, it will create a menu table, populated with some sample data. Included is a Security level, which you can use to display the menu pieces that are allowed for a particular level.

This works for me... if you can do something with it, let me know..

The "Menu Edit" page is very crude, allowing only addition of items. I hacked it together so I don't have to enter the stuff by hand.. It obviously needs LOTS more functionality such as
* Move menu items
* Delete menu items
* Visually distinguish between levels of the menu
* etc
* 
If you use this, please let me know so I can see it in action..

Have fun
